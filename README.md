### Project Description

This project is the final graded project for Udacity's Frontend Web Development program in partnership with OneTen of building an interactive landing page using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

### Usage

This project is not intended for any other use other than to be reviewed by one of Udacity's code reviewers to be graded.

### Things of Note

1. You will find the script tag for the project at the bottom of the index.html file before the closing body tag.

2. The unordered list in the nav tag is dynamically built in the app.js file and so you will find the list items there.

3. All css styles and media queries can be found in the styles.css file excluding the "visibility: hidden" property for the navigation bar upon scroll found at Line 126 in the app.js file.

### Thank You

To the person reviewing this project, thank you and be well.
